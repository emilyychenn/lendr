# My Personal Project - Money Loaning Tracker ðŸ’µ

## Description (Proposal)
Ever had difficulty keeping track of how much money you owe your friends or how much they owe you? In my daily life, I frequently find myself borrowing or lending money to/from friends whenever one of us forgets to bring our wallet or doesn't have enough change. We have even tried keeping track of every time one person buys the other a coffee, but this happens quite frequently and is difficult to keep track of. Currently, we are using a generic notes application to keep track of these exchanges, however, this is inefficient and doesn't show when and what the money was for â€” hence the idea for a **Money Loaning Tracker**. 

This program would ideally be used by individuals or groups of friends/colleagues/acquaintances in similar situations as described above to help keep track of who owes money to whom. The application's core features are listed below under *User Stories*.

## User Stories

As a typical user, I want to be able to:
- add a new contact to whom I owe money or who owes me money, to my list of contacts
- add new transaction(s) to an existing contact, and include details such as the date and amount owed
- view a list of the people (my contacts) and their overall owed balance
- view a list of transactions for a selected contact
- when I select the quit option, have the option to save my list of contacts (and overall owed balances) to a file
- optionally load my account data from a file when the program starts
