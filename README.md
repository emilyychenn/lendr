# My Personal Project - Money Loaning Tracker ðŸ’µ

## Description (Proposal)
Ever had difficulty keeping track of how much money you owe your friends or how much they owe you? In my daily life, I frequently find myself borrowing or lending money to/from friends whenever one of us forgets to bring our wallet or doesn't have enough change. We have even tried keeping track of every time one person buys the other a coffee, but this happens quite frequently and is difficult to keep track of. Currently, we are using a generic notes application to keep track of these exchanges, however, this is inefficient and doesn't show when and what the money was for â€” hence the idea for a *money loaning tracker*. 

This program would ideally be used by individuals or groups of friends/colleagues/acquaintances in similar situations as described above to help keep track of who owes money to whom. The application's **core features** will include:
- the names of the people who owe you money or who you owe money to
- the total amount, amount paid, and pending amount
- a total statement to see your overall owed/owing balance

Additional features that may be implemented **after** the core functionality is complete could include:
- the ability to include a file or an image of a receipt from the payment
- a report/summary to view your history: displaying money in and out over different periods of time
- a currency converter to support different currencies
- the option to add interest to loans (for individuals with larger debts to banks etc.)
- a button that allows users to quickly mark a debt as paid instead of manually entering the amount
- the ability to log in with a username and password to an account

## User Stories

As a typical user, I want to be able to:
- add a new contact to whom I owe money or who owes me money
- add a new loan to an existing contact, and include details such as the date and amount owed
- add a payment when part or all of a loan has been paid
- view a list of the people who I owe money to and who owe money to me

Later (if time), the following features will be implemented for users:
- edit the details of a loan at any time
- view the total balance to see my overall owed/owing balance
- select any contact and view the payment history
- view payment deadlines with interest (optional) added over time
